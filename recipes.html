        <p>
            Soak urad dal, rice, and fenugreek for 5-6 hours. And grind it along with the cooked rice and water until it reaches a smooth consistency.
            Then keep it aside for 6-7 hours for fermentation. The batter is ready to use. You can add some oil in the batter for more crispiness. Heat a flat surface iron pan or non-stick pan,
            then (apply oil for iron pan)  pour ½ a cup of dosa batter into it and spread it into a round shape. When one side is cooked,
            flip it to the other side and cook it until it turns golden brown color. Dosa is ready to serve. Continue the process for rest of the batter. <br>
            **The batter can be stored in a refridgerator for  2 days**

        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <p>
            In a bowl, whisk together milk, butter, vanilla extract and egg.  Make it soft and fluffy. Add the dry ingredients to it and mix it. Don’t overmix.
            Preheat your non stick pan or griddle in a low flame. About 2 mins. Lightly grease your pan with a little butter. Take a ¼ cup of batter (to get evenly shaped pancakes). Start pouring from the middle, then continue pouring slowly in a circular motion so that the batter spreads into perfect round shapes.
            Don’t rush the cooking by over heating or increased flame. In a meantime, you will see bubbles starting to form on top (batter side). Now flip your pancake, using a spatula. (use your wrist instead of your whole hands for flipping). Cook the other side as well. Your easy spongy pancakes are ready to be served.

            In a microwave bowl add oats, salt, water and milk. (oats to liquid ratio, making it 1:2 gives a perfect consistency and milk or water can be taken in any ratio, here I have taken in 1:1 ratio). 
            Heat the mixture for 2 minutes in microwave. Now the base is ready to serve. Add sliced bananas, nuts, maple syrup for toppings. Or fruits for a complete healthy way. 
             Be creative with the toppings. Enjoy!

            Heat a pan, pour ghee into it. Fry cashew nuts in it and keep it aside. In the same pan, roast the semolina as well (until it has a good fragrance). Mix the yellow food color with warm water. And pour this water into the semolina in intervals. Keep stirring it, such that there won’t be any lumps formed. Add sugar simultaneously along with adding water. Make sure the mixture is combined well. When the semolina thickens, add crushed cardamom to it. Cover and simmer this mixture for 2 mins till it cooks well. 
            Add more ghee and sort well until the Kesari separates from the pan. Now Kesari is ready to serve. Add Roasted cashews and saffron on top of it for decoration. 
            <br>**store kesari in an air-tight conatiner and refrigerate.**
